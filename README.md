## Setup
Note: This assumes you have cloned the repo, you have nodejs installed, you are in the root directory of the app,
and that you currently have [cow-api](https://github.com/joewang704/cow-api) set up and running.

1) Run `npm install`

2) Open a terminal tab/window and run `npm run watch`

4) App should now be accessible at localhost:8080

## Troubleshooting

If you see `undefined`, check that you currently have the [cow-api](https://github.com/joewang704/cow-api) up and running.
